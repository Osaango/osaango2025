## The Problem

We pinpointed the most problematic areas in service flow and digital services using data analysis and design thinking. This helped us plan and implement rapid experiments, lowering costs and leading to faster development cycles.

## The Solution

We designed a new modular and API-driven IT architecture and rearranged the organization. The goal is to free lawyers' time for more productive sales and customer work.

## Examples of Deliverables

We assisted Fondia in securing € 2 million from Business Finland for their development work for the upcoming two years. Our engagement combines service design, enterprise architecture, API design, API test automation consulting, and CRM, ERP, and document management migration cases. We helped plan the AI (RAG) based solution "AI Laywer" that uses the legal insights that Fondia has collected, but also takes care not to advice in matters that it does not have proven knowledge of.

## Lessons learned

It is very important to understand the cultural differences of the Nordic and Baltic operating countries. Each country organization also has its stage of market maturity and client expectations.

These impact the solution's design and priorities as much as the technology. Business priorities and the market for API-integratable SaaS solutions are ever-changing. The key is to have a clear vision for the long-term target business goals. The architecture runway can then be much shorter.
