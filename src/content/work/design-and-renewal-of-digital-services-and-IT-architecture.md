## Challenge

The client needed to build new digital capabilities while still operating a complex, high-reliability environment. They faced siloed systems, inconsistent interfaces and growing demands for inter-agency communication.

## What we did

- Mapped cross-service information flows and integration pain points.
- Designed an API-driven architecture to improve interoperability and reduce system coupling.
- Facilitated co-creation sessions to align agencies, IT teams and external suppliers.
- Provided integration and API design support for early service pilots.

## Outcome

A clearer architectural direction, improved cross-agency collaboration and a concrete plan for implementing API-based interoperability in a regulated environment.
