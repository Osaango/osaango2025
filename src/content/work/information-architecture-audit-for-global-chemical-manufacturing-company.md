## Challenge

The organisation needed to modernise several digital services while ensuring interoperability, data availability and secure integration with partners and legacy systems.

## What we did

- Conducted a current-state integration and architecture review.
- Defined domain boundaries, integration patterns and API opportunities across services.
- Facilitated stakeholder workshops to align service owners, architects and vendors.
- Created a future-state architecture with clearer interface responsibilities and governance.

## Outcome

A modern integration architecture that supports multi-vendor delivery, scalable digital services and faster adaptation to regulatory or service changes.
