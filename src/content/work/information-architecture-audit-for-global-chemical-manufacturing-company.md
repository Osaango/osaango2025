## The Problem

 The client needed to align its operations with global architecture visions, particularly in transforming its e-commerce capabilities to be more efficient and user-friendly.

## The Solution

We conducted an in-depth Information Architecture (IA) audit. The audit focused on aligning the client’s current business processes with industry-standard solutions in the target state. 

The goal was to transform the client’s sales and marketing-related design flows, emphasizing e-commerce even in B2B scenarios. 

We used the business capability mapping approach to understand their information architecture. By categorizing the client's B2B customer experience workflows into business capabilities, we assessed the client's current status and future relevance. Through one-on-one interviews with stakeholders and detailed document analysis, we drew insights and identified gaps in their current system.

In this project, we supported a design agency in charge of designing the customer experience and business transformation.

## Outcome

The company has been implementing these recommendations, moving toward a more integrated, efficient, and user-friendly online sales architecture. Its data management capabilities have improved, and it is in the process of upgrading its order management system.

## Examples of deliverables

1. **Prioritizing Data Management and Integration:** Based on the interviews, it was evident that the lack of two-way integration, detailed data, or quality data significantly hindered their ability to achieve their business goals. By improving data management and integration, the client could offer more accurate product availability and detailed order history data.

2. **Transforming Order Management:** The client's current system lacked the flexibility required for online sales. We recommended implementing a new, fully integratable CPQ system with integrated pricing and availability management, turning their order management into an online-ready capability.

3. **Adopting a Main Architecture Approach:** To ensure a seamless flow of information and avoid data quality issues, we recommended using API products. This would allow for reusable services compatible with many internal and external solutions.

## Lessons learned

* This case underscored the importance of aligning business capabilities with customer experience workflows.   
* It also highlighted that any digital transformation initiative, especially one related to e-commerce, must prioritize data management and integration.   
* Lastly, adopting an API-driven approach can significantly streamline operations and boost efficiency. The case demonstrated that digital transformation requires a deep understanding of existing processes, clear goals, and an actionable roadmap.
