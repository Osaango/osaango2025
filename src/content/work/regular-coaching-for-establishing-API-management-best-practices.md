## The problem

First, the problem was that APIs were not understood as a technology or a means to a business outcome. After the introduction to innovative ways of connecting APIs to the business strategy discussions, the next problem was to design and develop them, at scale, with legacy and AI. Since the finance sector is a highly regulated industry, there were extra requirements to take into consideration. There were competing methods, and change resistance, lack of knowledge of existing systems, new technologies, and business requirements were also issues.

## The Solution

We worked alongside the technology leadership team and the API enablement function. We needed to communicate and understand the case for APIs more clearly. We also helped clarify many design and architectural points and API standards. Our coaching, training, and consulting were related to APIs, software development, and infrastructure management practices.

With our partners, we have helped produce materials, facilitate sessions, and create best practices. We also answered ad hoc needs during several weekly meetings with relevant stakeholders.

## Lessons learned

The client has started to adopt the APIOps Cycles approach, which we have helped fit to their other processes and guidelines. This is transforming the way their API management and enablement team provides assistance and tools to the service teams.

We concluded the work by helping the client’s core team establish a weekly rhythm of content and stakeholder engagement at “API Mondays,” which started to attract a growing number of attendees and presenters.
