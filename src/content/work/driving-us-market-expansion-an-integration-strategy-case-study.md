## Challenge

A leading device management scaleup wanted to grow in the US market. With an existing product and partner strategy, integrations were a showstopper for growth. The company recognized an increasing demand for integrations from customers and partners. Their current platform and integration solutions couldn't meet the needs. The client wanted a fast-paced project focused on the US market.

## What we did

- Outlined the customer (buyer’s) journey and pre-sales support for integration.  
- Prioritized market positioning based on our market study and understanding the depth of knowledge of the integration user personas.
- Helped distinguish unknown variables, particularly with channels and segments.  
- Conceptualized the target solution, and collate stakeholder feedback. We leveraged methods such as the Lean Canvas and APIOps Cycles, collaborating with business and technology management to form assumptions.  
- Conducted a thorough assessment of data processing, the infrastructure, and the technology required.  
- Created an operational model, a roadmap, and pinpoint required roles and resources.

## Outcome
     
Through intensive market research and a deep dive into customer needs, we empowered the client to define a future-proof integration strategy and accelerate their US market expansion. This approach clarified the integration perspective and identified API-enabled integration technologies. The client was able to focus on 1-2 key segments. They were able to target the one real competitor, cutting through the noise of the 30+ potential integration partners and competitors.

This research led us to craft a revamped business model, operating model, and product roadmap. In total, we had 40 suggestions for improvement. Our team immersed itself in the customer journey and benchmarked touchpoints and features. We identified significant areas for improvement. Our team's external perspective expedited product development, sales, and marketing strategies.
