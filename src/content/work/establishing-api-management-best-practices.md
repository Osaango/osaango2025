## Challenge

The client had APIs in active use but lacked clarity on ownership, lifecycle, and quality expectations. Teams used different practices, leading to inconsistent delivery and slow onboarding for internal and external consumers.

## What we did

- Ran an API governance assessment across product and engineering teams.
- Facilitated sessions to define API roles, responsibilities and decision-making structures.
- Co-created lightweight design and documentation practices that fit their existing delivery model.
- Introduced an APIOps-based flow for iterating API design and quality.

## Outcome

The organisation aligned on shared API standards, removed friction between product and engineering, and created a repeatable governance model that improved API consistency and consumer onboarding.
